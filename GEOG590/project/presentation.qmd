## Why Chicago?

I love urban spaces, and exploring different facets of cities. 

The Chicago metro area is one of the largest urban areas in the world, but gets way less hype than NYC or Tokyo.

## The Data

Building footprint data from Chicago Data Store, a web repository of all the data the city of Chicago collects.

From the building footprints dataset, two variables are of importance

- year_built
- stories 

## The Challenges

- QGIS is a PAIN. 
- Tried to do aggregation by using a spatial join, was a lot of hassle
- Trying to squeeze out the most performance out of mapbox is a hassle as well.
